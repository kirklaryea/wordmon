In this game, the monster is going to choose a random word from the list of words in the file words.txt.

You must guess each letter in the random word the monster chose.

If the letter chosen by you is in the word the monster chose,then the letters respective blankspace will be filled in the program and added to the list "Correct".

Else if the letter is not in the monsters' word, the letter gets added to the list "Wrong" and the monster keeps getting closer.

You have a maximum of 6 guesses to get the correct word.

If all letters of the word are guessed before the monster arrives,YOU WIN!

Else if you max out your 6 attempts and still haven't guessed the word, you have lost.

The program will then display the monsters word at the end
